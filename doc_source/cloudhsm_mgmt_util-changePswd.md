# changePswd<a name="cloudhsm_mgmt_util-changePswd"></a>

The changePswd command in cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util changes the password of an existing user on the HSMs in the cluster\. 

Any user can change their own password\. Crypto officers \(COs and PCOs\) can also change the password of any other user\. You do not need to enter the current password to make the change\. However, you cannot change the password of a user who is logged into the AWS CloudHSM client or key\_mgmt\_util\.

Before you run any cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util command, you must [start cloudhsm\_mgmt\_util](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-getting-started.md#cloudhsm_mgmt_util-start), [enable end\-to\-end encryption](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-getting-started.md#cloudhsm_mgmt_util-enable_e2e), and [log in](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-getting-started.md#cloudhsm_mgmt_util-log-in) to the HSM\. Be sure that the user type of the account that you use to log in can run the commands you plan to use\.

If you add or delete HSMs, [update the configuration files](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-getting-started.md#cloudhsm_mgmt_util-setup) that the AWS CloudHSM client and the command line tools use\. Otherwise, the changes that you make might not be effective on all HSMs in the cluster\.

## Syntax<a name="changePswd-syntax"></a>

Because this command does not have named parameters, you must enter the arguments in the order specified in the syntax diagram\.

## Examples<a name="changePswd-examples"></a>

These examples show how to use changePassword to create new users in your HSMs\.

**Example : Change your password**  
Any user on the HSMs can use changePswd to change their own password\.   
The first command uses [info](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-info.md) to get the current user\. The output shows that the current user, `bob`, is a crypto user \(CU\)\.  

```
aws-cloudhsm> info server 0
Id      Name            Hostname        Port    State           Partition          LoginState
0       10.0.3.10       10.0.3.10       2225    Connected       hsm-aaaabbbbccc    Logged in as 'bob(CU)'

aws-cloudhsm> info server 1
Id      Name            Hostname        Port    State           Partition          LoginState
0       10.0.3.10       10.0.3.10       2225    Connected       hsm-ccccaaaabbb    Logged in as 'bob(CU)'
```
To change his password, `bob` runs changePswd with a new password, `newPasswerd`\.  
When the command completes, the password change is effective\.   

```
aws-cloudhsm> createUser CU bob newPasswerd

**Example : Change the password of another user**  
This example shows how to change password of a different user\. Any crypto officer \(CO, PCO\) can change the password of any user on the HSMs without specifying the existing password\.  
The first command uses [info](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-info.md) to confirm that `alice`, a CO, is logged into the HSMs in the cluster\.   

```
aws-cloudhsm>info server 0
Id      Name             Hostname         Port   State           Partition        LoginState
0       10.0.3.10        10.0.3.10        2225   Connected       hsm-aaaabbbbccc  Logged in as 'alice(CO)'

aws-cloudhsm>info server 1
Id      Name             Hostname         Port   State           Partition        LoginState
0       10.0.3.10        10.0.3.10        2225   Connected       hsm-ccccaaaabbb  Logged in as 'alice(CO)'
```
This command uses changePswd to change the password of `officer1`, another CO on the HSMs\. In this case, the command resets the password to `defaultPassword`, the password that this fictitious enterprise uses as its default\. Later, `officer1` can reset their password to a more secure value\.  

```
aws-cloudhsm>changePswd CO officer1 defaultPassword

## Arguments<a name="changePswd-params"></a>

Because this command does not have named parameters, you must enter the arguments in the order specified in the syntax diagram\.

```
changePswd <user-type> <user-name> <password> [1FA | 2FA]
```

**<user\-type>**  
Specifies the current type of the user whose password you are changing\. You cannot use changePswd to change the user type\.   
Valid values are **CO**, **CU**, **AU**, **PCO**, and **PRECO**\.  
To get the user type, use [listUsers](cloudhsm_mgmt_util-listUsers.md)\. For detailed information about the user types on an HSM, see [HSM Users](hsm-users.md)\.  
Required: Yes

**<user\-name>**  
Specifies the user's friendly name\. This parameter is not case\-sensitive\. You cannot use changePswd to change the user name\.   
Required: Yes

**<password>**  
Specifies a new password for the user\. Enter a string of 7 to 32 characters\. This value is case sensitive\. The password appears in plaintext when you type it\.   
Required: Yes

**1FA | 2FA**  
Enables or disables dual\-factor authentication for the new user\. Enter `1FA` or `2FA`\.   
This parameter is valid only when the cluster has been configured for dual\-factor authentication\.  
Required: No  
Default: `1FA`\. Dual factor authentication is not enabled\.
